    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am Gerald Amos Shimo, a Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of Arkansas at 
        Pine Bluff with a perfect 4.0 GPA, graduating in May 2027. I hold certifications in Google Data Analytics, 
        Python, and Machine Learning, and I am proficient in Python, C++, SQL, and web development tools. 
        My experience includes working as a lab assistant visualizing quantum materials, developing scalable AI applications as an AI project 
        developer, and teaching web development to high school students as a volunteer instructor. As Vice President of the Computer Science Club and a 
        committee member of the National Society of Black Engineers, I have facilitated partnerships and organized workshops to enhance career development. 
        Some of my notable projects include a pantry inventory app and a telehealth platform, both of which earned recognition in hackathons. Additionally, 
        I have participated in competitive programs like Meta Scholars (TMCF) and L.A.B., where I refined my leadership, teamwork, and technical skills. 
        Outside of academics and work, I enjoy soccer, traveling, and swimming.</p>
